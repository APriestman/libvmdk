TODO
* implement libvmdk_extent_file_read_grain_group_element_data
* get grain data by grain table
  - read grain data - move sparse to read_buffer e.g. qcow ?
  - grain table wrap extent file table
  - refactor grain_table_list
  - remove unused functions from libvmdk_extent_table after refactor
  - move sparse check out of libvmdk_grain_data_read_element_data ?

* descriptor file: put disk data base in fvalue table ?
* vmdkinfo: add byte size string support

* code clean up:
  - support and locale functions
* add glob functions
* debug output
  - descriptor file: disk database
  - extent file: flags
  - extent file: compression method
